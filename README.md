# BRFSS
Tools to analyze BRFSS data from CDC

### Ambition
1. Create a workflow schema that cleans, prepares, adds derived variables, and more for multiple years of BRFSS data.
2. Build on this workflow schema, integrating it into an application that allows for the creation of data visualization, tables, and reports that are dynamic and reflexive to various degrees of user input.
3. Create a tool that creates interactive data visualizations that can be exported and hosted on websites by collaborators.
